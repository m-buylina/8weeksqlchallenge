# A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS subscriptions
JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS plans
ON plans.plan_id = subscriptions.plan_id
WHERE customer_id < 9
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
```
   
| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date               |
