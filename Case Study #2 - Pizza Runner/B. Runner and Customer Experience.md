# B. Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period?
```SQL
SELECT week, count(runner_id) FROM (
  SELECT
	runner_id,
	ceil(DATE_PART('doy', registration_date) / 7) AS week
  FROM pizza_runner.runners) AS runners_week
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week
```
I decided to calculate week by myself because in this case 2021-01-01 is 53 week.


| week | count |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1    | 2     |
| 2    | 1     |
| 3    | 1     |

---
2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
``` SQL
SELECT AVG(arrive_time) FROM (
  SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (pickup_time - order_time))) AS arrive_time,
    runner_orders_temp.order_id
  FROM customer_orders_temp
  JOIN runner_orders_temp
  ON customer_orders_temp.order_id = runner_orders_temp.order_id
  WHERE runner_orders_temp.cancellation is NULL
  GROUP BY runner_orders_temp.order_id
) as runner_time;
```

| avg    |
| ------ |
| 15.625 |

---
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```SQL
SELECT count_pizzas, AVG(time_prepare) FROM (
  SELECT
    customer_orders_temp.order_id,
    COUNT(pizza_id) as count_pizzas,
    EXTRACT('minutes' FROM (pickup_time - order_time)) AS time_prepare
  FROM customer_orders_temp
  JOIN runner_orders_temp
  ON customer_orders_temp.order_id = runner_orders_temp.order_id
  WHERE cancellation IS NULL
  GROUP BY customer_orders_temp.order_id, EXTRACT('minutes' FROM (pickup_time - order_time))) AS prep
GROUP BY count_pizzas
ORDER BY count_pizzas;
```
| count_pizzas | avg |
| ------------ | --- |
| 1            | 12  |
| 2            | 18  |
| 3            | 29  |

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
``` SQL
SELECT customer_id, AVG(distance) as avg_distance FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT order_id, customer_id
  FROM customer_orders_temp) AS dist_orders
JOIN runner_orders_temp
ON dist_orders.order_id = runner_orders_temp.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id
```

| customer_id | avg_ |
| ----------- | ---- |
| 101         | 20   |
| 102         | 18.4 |
| 103         | 23.4 |
| 104         | 10   |
| 105         | 25   |

---
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
``` SQL
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) as diff FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
```

| diff |
| ---- |
| 30   |

---
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
``` SQL
SELECT 
  runner_id,
  order_id,
  ROUND((distance / duration  * 60)) AS avg_speed_km_h
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
```
| runner_id | order_id | avg_km_h |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1         | 1        | 38       |
| 1         | 2        | 44       |
| 1         | 3        | 40       |
| 2         | 4        | 35       |
| 3         | 5        | 40       |
| 2         | 7        | 60       |
| 2         | 8        | 94       |
| 1         | 10       | 60       |

---
In general the average speed accounted for 45 (without 94), but there is extreme value 94. Ð¡ould this be an error in the database?
